📋 Backlog (Prioritized)
High Priority: Core & Security
 * Strict Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement meta-tag headers to block all outbound connections (connect-src 'none'), enforcing the zero-trust promise. (Dependencies are stored in a directory next to the main html/js file)
 * Allow multiple authoritative documents to upload
 * Create a set of demo documents that demonstrate how this works. For example: requirements for a private person buying a phone, against a specification or review of a single phone. 
 * Chaptered Source Structure: Organize the single HTML file into the 7 chapters (Header, Vendored Libs, Model Manager, State Engine, Core Logic, AI Pipeline, UI).
 * Model Sideloading (Chapter 3): Create the "Import" UI to allow users to select local model files and store them in IndexedDB (NOT localStorage).
 * Model Unloading/Eviction: Add a "Purge Models" button in Settings that wipes the IndexedDB object stores to prevent Ivanti MDM sync bloat.
 * Vanilla i18n: Implement a simple dictionary-based translation system for all UI strings (NL/EN).
Medium Priority: Analysis & Logic
 * Some better PDF parsing solution, such as MuPDF or Docling 258M Integration: Implement the WebGPU version for document structure analysis and OCR.
 * Deterministic Matcher: Build the regex-based heading and requirement-ID extractor (runs before any AI).
 * Granite 278 Embedding: Add semantic matching using cosine similarity (Dot product) for the "Assisted" check layer.
 * Smarter Chunking: Move from fixed-length to structural chunking (based on headings detected by Docling).
Low Priority: Enhanced UX
 * Heatmap & Coverage View: Visual matrix showing which requirements are covered by which document sections.
 * CSV Export: One-click copy-to-clipboard or download of the findings matrix.
✅ Definition of Done (DoD)
Deployment & Portability
 * Single-File Logic: All logic, styles, and dependencies are vendored into one .html file.
 * Offline Execution: The app must run via file:/// protocol with zero internet access.
 * Browser Storage Partitioning:
   * localStorage: Used ONLY for small settings (<1MB) like theme and email.
   * IndexedDB: Used for models and document cache.
 * Ivanti-Friendly Sync: An explicit "Clear Local Data" and "Unload Models" function must exist to reduce profile size to <1MB before a user logs off.
Architectural Integrity (ATAM)
 * Cognitive Load: The entire app logic (excluding vendored libs) must not exceed 2500 lines of code.
 * Table of Contents: The code must maintain a clear, commented TOC at the top of the <script> tag.
 * No Compiled Tools: No TypeScript, Minifiers (for your code), or Bundlers. Raw ES6+ Javascript only.
 * Composability: Functions must be "pure" where possible (input -> output) to allow for easy extraction into a repository.
Performance & Hardware
 * WebGPU Target: Verified to run on DWR laptops and flagship Android phones (Pixel 8+, S23+) with >11GB RAM.
 * Crash-Only Design: The app saves the current "session" state to IndexedDB every 5 seconds. If the tab crashes, it reloads exactly where the user left off.
 * Manual Memory Management: The app must explicitly call .dispose() on WebGPU tensors/models when the "Unload" trigger is activated.
🛠 Programming Table of Contents (Chaptered Development)
Your single file should follow this strict internal sequence to maintain maintainability, for example:
```
/* CHECKIT SINGLE-FILE APP TOC
  1. CONSTANTS & CSP CONFIG
  2. VENDORED DEPENDENCIES (pdf.js, transformers.js, docling.js)
  3. SYSTEM: IndexedDB & Model Management (Sideload/Unload)
  4. SYSTEM: State Persistence (Crash-only recovery)
  5. LOGIC: Document Processing (Deterministic / Docling)
  6. LOGIC: AI Inference (Granite Embeddings & Semantic Search)
  7. UI: Components (Heatmap, Settings, Results)
  8. UI: Event Listeners & Boot Sequence
*/
```
A note on Model Unloading
When using transformers.js with WebGPU, simply deleting the file from IndexedDB isn't enough for the current session. You must ensure the developer includes a pipeline.dispose() or similar cleanup to clear the VRAM/RAM immediately so the user can see the memory usage drop in the browser's Task Manager.
